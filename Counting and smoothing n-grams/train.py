# Ling 165 Lab 1 kwiseth Feb and Mar 2013
# train.py
# Create dictionary of bigrams from training data (brown.train)
# Functions get_bigrams and update_counts adapted from Hahn Koo Ling115 lecture of 7-Nov-2012

# Extract bigrams from each line in a file and update a bigram_frequency_dictionary.
# Additional functions for building a word list and word counts.
# 22-Feb stripped this down to the bare essentials-- just get the dictionary built from training data
#		and also build a list of words (for vocabulary)
# 23-Mar completed my 'refactoring' to include method for getting words and word counts
#       and also using more Python-esque approaches (list comprehensions replacing counters/loops)
